This is a prototype downloaded from the [Devouring Details](https://devouringdetails.com) platform. There are several font, CSS, and React files included.

## Getting Started

First, import the files into your framework or project of choice (Next.js, Vite, ...).

The `system.css` file includes global CSS variables and a [Tailwind 4 configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#simplified-installation) theme required for the components.

You should import the `system.css` file somewhere in your app root, like so:

```css
import "./system.css";
```

Next, install any relevant dependencies used in `source.tsx` and import the exported component from this file.

(Optionally, the relevant fonts are included in the `fonts` directory if you wish to use them.)
