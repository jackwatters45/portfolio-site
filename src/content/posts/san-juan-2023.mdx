What to say about San Juan. I've always wanted to visit Puerto Rico and was finally able to make it happen this December. I'm typically a big planner when I travel but leading up to this trip I was super busy with coding and just decided to wing it. Next time I go (and I am planning on returning) I'll make sure I get in a lot more of the famous sites, but this trip ended up being about one thing: nightlife.

The hostel I stayed at (Mango Mansion) was great, but it was definitely a hostel that people come to with the intention of partying. Now I'm not complaining but I don't think I would've lasted any longer there. The nightlife, though, was incredible; probably my favorite I've ever witnessed. The bars were awesome - a great vibe, cheap enough drinks, and of course great music. The people were also great - both the other residents of the hostel and the people I met out on the town. 

My first day was pretty chill. I got in around 6 and happened to meet another new hostel resident, named Gabriel, as we both tried to find the entrance. We found some dinner, hit the super useful 24-hour grocery store and returned to the hostel. I was tired from a full day of travel and was planning on getting a solid days rest. That didn't end up working out; I ended up getting into a conversation with someone in the kitchen as I grabbed some water before bed. It was his last day there so he wasn't planning on getting much sleep that night. After a few beers, he mentioned walking down to the beach. Gabriel was just finishing up with a university final so we waited for him and set off for the beach. We spent a while at the beach, decided to Uber into Old San Juan to see if anything was still going on there, and eventual ventured into La Perla. La Perla was quite a sight - basically a super small historical shanty town that never really closes down. We met up with some other members of our hostel for a bit and then returned back to the hostel. Overall, a fun but late first night and a good intro on what was to come in San Juan.

Day two was pretty uneventful. I woke up kind of late, did a little work, walked around the nearby area and got some coffee. Eventually went back to Old San Juan for dinner and some drinks with Gabriel. Funny enough later that night we returned back to Old San Juan to meet up with a group of people from the hostel and ended up at the same bar we went to earlier that night. We never caught up with the group that night but still had a solid night. We made it to two bars that night: La Factoría and El Cafetín, both of which were awesome and I returned to multiple times. They also happened to be right next to each other which was super nice.

Like most days, day three started a little later than planned. I went with Gabriel and a new friend George to the Bacardi factory tour. It was fun, not a highlight by any means but still interesting to see. After that I went to Old San Juan to explore and walk around. It was a nice well-needed break from being super social. Only problem was it rained - a lot. I ended up walking 90 minutes back in the rain to the hostel, which ended up being super enjoyable and I got to see a slightly different view of San Juan. I don't remember how it happened, but I ended up meeting Justin, Maya, and Lior that night. We ended up all going out together (Gabriel as well). It was a great night; I actually ended up staying up talking with Maya all night. This was probably my favorite night in San Juan.

I ended up "taking a nap" around noon the next day and finally awoke around four or five. Mostly just ended up hanging around the hostel that night and went out with a bunch of people from the hostel to La Placita - which was basically just a bunch of bars near our hostel. Super fun night and got to dance to a lot of Reggaeton. I eventually went with some others to check out the Rauw Alejhandro after concert party but we didn't get in so I watched the end of the UFC event and walked back home.

Next day was another eventful one. I went with a group to El Yunque - the only rainforest within a territory of the United States. It was bit of a dumb trip at first but eventually we found some really cool waterfalls. That night I went with Justin to a Rauq Alejandro concert which was cool but we didn't know most of the songs so we left early to go say goodbye to George. We hung around the hostel for a bit and I went to the Rauw Alejandro after party with some others from the Hostel. It was super cool - I think we got back around 6am or something. 

I don't know why but I decided it would be a good idea to stay up all night again and ended up going for a sunrise walk which was fun at the time... I made it for a while.. Got lunch and went to the beach with Justin and two others; I ended up taking a nap on the beach and when we got back. I think I just hung out the rest of the day and went to bed at a decent hour for probably the only night all trip. 

Made it to the airport at like seven in the morning an my trip had come to an end.

I really did have a great time and the trip further cemented my desire to go see the world and work in hostels or something similar. I read most of the Alchemist on my trip and it had a similar lasting effect on me. I think it is what I am meant to be doing. Until next time PR.
